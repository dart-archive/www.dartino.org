# Dartino hardware support and custom bring-up

Dartino supports several MCU and MPU embedded development boards natively;
please see [getting started](/getting-started/) for the full list.

If you are interested in bringing Dartino up on a different platform, this
should be doable if the platform has the following characteristics:

* A main CPU based on either regular PC hardware, or with an ARM Cortex A or
 M core.
* At least 128kb RAM (future versions might support less RAM)
* At least 256kb flash (future versions might support less flash)
* Is supported by FreeRTOS

To get additional details, please [contact us](/faq/).
