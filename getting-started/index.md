If you just want to see what Dartino programs look like, take a peek at our
[samples page](/samples/).

If you would like to use Dartino a different board, please see the [custom
bring-up](/custom-bring-up.html) page.

*Note:* We currently do not support Windows, so you will need a development PC
running MacOS and Linux. Future versions are expected to support Windows.
