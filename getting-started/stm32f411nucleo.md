### Selecting a target

The SDK is configured to use the [STM32F746](/getting-started/stm32f746disco/)
board per default. We need to change to the STM32F411RE board:

  * Open the file `<dartino sdk location>/internal/.dartino-settings` in a text editor.
  * Uncomment the line `// "device": "stm32f411re-nucleo",`.
  * Save the file.

### Building and flashing

Now we can build and flash a program to the STM32F411RE (on Linux, replace
`/Volumes/` with `/media/<username>/`):

```
dartino build samples/stm32f411re-nucleo/blinky.dart
cp samples/stm32f411re-nucleo/blinky.bin /Volumes/NODE_F411RE/
```

After a few seconds you should see the LED on the board blinking!

The build command compiled the blinky.dart program to byte code, and linked that
with the Dartino run-time and the [FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/) embedded
operating system. This created the image file blinky.bin which you should see in
your filesystem next to blinky.dart.
