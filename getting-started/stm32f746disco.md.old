### Building and flashing

Now we can compile the program into a flashable image, and flash that image
to the board (on Linux, replace `/Volumes/` with `/media/<username>/`):

```
dartino build samples/general/hello.dart
cp samples/general/hello.bin /Volumes/DIS_F746NG/
```

After a few seconds you should see output resembling this on your board:

```
Hello from FreeRTOS.
```

The build command compiled the hello.dart program to byte code, and linked that
with the Dartino run-time and the [FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/) embedded
operating system. This created the image file hello.bin which you should see in
your filesystem next to hello.dart.
