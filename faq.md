# FAQ

Please take a look at the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) below, and if that
does not answer your question, please join us in our [Dartino
Discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dartino-discuss) group.

* *Q*: What is the Dartino Project?

* *A*: Dartino is an **experimental** project to enable highly productive
 development for embedded devices (see 'what is supported' below). It is
 powered by the [Dart
 language](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html) and a
 new fast, lean runtime optimized for embedded systems.

* *Q*:  What is the state of the project?
* *A*: Dartino is an experimental project in the alpha phase. Things are
 still incomplete, and under development. Please take a look, [try it
 out](/getting-started/), and give us some [feedback](feedback.html)!

* *A*: What is supported?
* *Q*: You need a client PC for writing your program, and a target device for
 executing it. The current SDK supports Linux and Mac as the client OS (sorry,
 no Windows support yet), and [several embedded devices](/getting-started/).

* *Q*: What about Pub, dartfmt, docgen, analyzer from the [Dart
 SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk/)?
* *A*: These are currently not supported for Dartino.

* *Q*: Do you have any downloadable presentation material about Dartino?
* *A*: Yes, see <a href="/downloads/Dartino-Modern-Embedded-Programming.pdf"
