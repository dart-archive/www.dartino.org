# Fletch project FAQ

Fletch is still highly experimental, so we are sure you have lots of questions.
Please take a look at the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) below, and if that
does not answer your question, please join us in our [Fletch
Discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fletch-discuss) group.

## FAQ

* *Q*: What is the Fletch Project?
* *A*: Fletch is an **experimental** project to enable highly productive
 development for devices (see 'what is supported'). It is powered by the [Dart
 language](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html) and a
 fast, lean runtime.

* *Q*:  What is the state of the project?
* *A*: Fletch is an experimental project in the pre-alpha phase. Things are
 still incomplete, and under development. Please take a look, [try it
 out](index.html), and give us some [feedback](feedback.html)!

* *A*: What is supported?
* *Q*: You need a client PC for writing your program, and a target device for
 executing it. The current SDK supports Linux and Mac as the client OS (sorry,
 no Windows support yet), and the [Raspberry Pi 2 Model
 B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) as its only
 target device .

* *Q*: What about Pub, dartfmt, docgen, analyzer from the [Dart
 SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk/)?
* *A*: These are currently not supported for Fletch.
